Hi! My name is Erasyl, I’m a beginner programmer from Aktobe, Kazakhstan.
I’m learning Python and exploring new technologies.
I develop websites and chatbots on order, participate in sport programming, and regularly upload my projects to GitHub.
I’m passionate about growing as a backend developer and improving my skills every day.
